## AWS Golang SDK Example Code

Looking for samples on how to use the Golang AWS SDK for everyday automation? Things like authenticating with MFA, writing results to a CSV, or simply how to read the documentation to do all the things. 

Well here's a growing list of AWS automation scripts to get your started. 

How to get started:
* Clone, DL, or Fork the repo
* update the .env.sample and rename to .env
* GET the dependencies
* Comment out what you need on the main.go file and run it. 

Sure it's not ideal to comment and uncomment commands as needed but it gets the data I need quickly. You could do the same, or you could spit out the binaries for all the commands, just add some flags.
